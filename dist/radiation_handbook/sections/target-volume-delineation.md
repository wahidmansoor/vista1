# Target Volume Delineation

## Fundamental Concepts
Target volume delineation follows the **ICRU framework** for standardized definition and reporting. Each volume serves a specific purpose in the planning process.

> üéØ **Clinical Pearl:** Always review diagnostic imaging (CT/MRI/PET) during contouring to ensure accurate target definition, particularly for post-operative cases where anatomy may be distorted.

### Volume Hierarchy
| Volume | Definition | Purpose |
|--------|------------|----------|
| **GTV** | Gross visible/palpable tumor | Primary disease target |
| **CTV** | GTV + subclinical spread | Account for microscopic disease |
| **ITV** | CTV + internal motion | Account for organ movement |
| **PTV** | ITV/CTV + setup margin | Account for uncertainties |

## Contouring Guidelines

### 1. Image Requirements
‚ñ£ Contrast-enhanced planning CT  
‚ñ£ Registered diagnostic imaging  
‚ñ£ Appropriate window/level settings  
‚ñ£ Slice thickness ‚â§ 3mm  
‚ñ£ Clear patient instructions  

### 2. GTV Definition
| Scenario | Approach |
|----------|----------|
| **Primary Disease** | Use all imaging modalities |
| **Nodal Disease** | Include entire node |
| **Post-op** | Based on pre-op imaging |
| **Residual** | Clinical exam + imaging |

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Caution:** For post-operative cases, surgical clips and changes should guide CTV rather than GTV definition unless residual disease is clearly present.

### 3. CTV Expansion
| Site | Typical Margin | Special Considerations |
|------|---------------|----------------------|
| **H&N** | 5-10mm | Respect anatomic barriers |
| **Lung** | 6-8mm | Include lymphatics |
| **Breast** | Visible tissue | Use clinical boundaries |
| **Prostate** | 5-15mm | Variable by risk group |
| **CNS** | 1.5-2cm | Respect anatomic barriers |

## Standard Margins by Site
1. **Brain**
   - Low Grade: GTV + 2cm
   - High Grade: T1 + edema + 2cm
   - SRS: No expansion

2. **Head & Neck**
   - Primary: 5-10mm
   - Node+: 10mm
   - Node-: 5mm
   - Respect barriers

3. **Thoracic**
   - NSCLC: 6-8mm
   - SCLC: Include nodal stations
   - Respect natural barriers

4. **Breast**
   - Whole breast: Clinical boundaries
   - Boost: Cavity + 15mm
   - Chest wall: Include surgical bed

## Quality Assurance Steps
1. **Pre-Contouring**
   - Review all imaging
   - Check fusion accuracy
   - Review surgical notes
   
2. **During Contouring**
   - Use standardized names
   - Follow color conventions
   - Document deviations
   
3. **Post-Contouring**
   - Peer review
   - Check margin generation
   - Verify volume continuity

## Common Pitfalls
| Error | Prevention Strategy |
|-------|-------------------|
| **Missing Extensions** | Review in all planes |
| **Over-contouring** | Use anatomic boundaries |
| **Inconsistent Names** | Use standard library |
| **Fusion Errors** | Verify registration |

## Documentation Requirements
1. **Target Definitions**
   - GTV basis
   - CTV rationale
   - PTV margins
   
2. **Protocol Deviations**
   - Record justification
   - Alternative approach
   - Clinical rationale

3. **Review Status**
   - Contour approval
   - Peer review date
   - Changes made

## AI-Generated Summary
- Target delineation follows standardized ICRU definitions
- Site-specific margins based on patterns of spread
- Quality assurance crucial at each step
- Documentation essential for deviations
- Peer review integral to process
