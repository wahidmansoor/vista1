# Bone Metastases

## Clinical Assessment
Palliative radiotherapy for bone metastases requires careful assessment of symptoms, functional status, and prognosis to determine optimal fractionation and technique.

> 🎯 **Clinical Pearl:** Single fraction radiotherapy (8Gy x 1) provides equivalent pain relief to multi-fraction regimens for uncomplicated bone metastases, though retreatment rates are higher.

### Initial Evaluation
| Assessment | Details | Impact |
|------------|---------|---------|
| **Pain** | Severity, character | Fractionation |
| **Function** | Weight-bearing, mobility | Urgency |
| **Stability** | SINS score | Surgical need |
| **Prognosis** | Expected survival | Treatment choice |

---

## Treatment Selection

### 1. Dose Fractionation
| Indication | Regimen | Comments |
|------------|---------|----------|
| **Uncomplicated** | 8Gy/1fx | Standard of care |
| **High risk** | 20Gy/5fx | Better durability |
| **Post-op** | 30Gy/10fx | Standard post-fixation |
| **Retreatment** | 8Gy/1fx | Safe and effective |

### 2. SINS Classification
| Score | Recommendation | Timing |
|-------|----------------|--------|
| **0-6** | Stable | RT alone |
| **7-12** | Indeterminate | Surgical consult |
| **13-18** | Unstable | Surgery first |

> ⚠️ **Caution:** Patients with neurologic deficits or unstable fractures require urgent surgical evaluation before RT.

## Simulation Process

### 1. Setup Considerations
▣ Comfortable position  
▣ Reproducible alignment  
▣ Minimal immobilization  
▣ Pain management  
▣ Quick completion  

### 2. Imaging Requirements
| Site | Modality | Special Notes |
|------|----------|--------------|
| **Spine** | CT sim | Include above/below |
| **Pelvis** | CT sim | Bladder state |
| **Extremity** | CT or 2D | Simple setup |
| **Skull** | CT sim | Head support |

## Treatment Planning

### 1. Target Definition
| Volume | Margin | Consideration |
|--------|--------|---------------|
| **CTV** | Involved bone | Anatomic compartment |
| **PTV** | 0.5-1.0 cm | Setup uncertainty |
| **Field** | 1-2 vertebrae | Above/below |

### 2. Technique Selection
| Approach | Indication | Benefit |
|----------|------------|---------|
| **PA Spine** | Simple vertebral | Quick setup |
| **Parallel Opposed** | Long bone | Uniform dose |
| **3D Conformal** | Complex anatomy | OAR sparing |
| **IMRT** | Retreatment | Cord sparing |

## Treatment Delivery

### 1. Setup Verification
| Site | Imaging | Frequency |
|------|---------|-----------|
| **Spine** | kV imaging | Each fraction |
| **Pelvis** | kV imaging | Each fraction |
| **Extremity** | Weekly | As needed |
| **Complex** | CBCT | First fraction |

### 2. Treatment Management
1. **Pain Control**
   - Pre-medication
   - Position comfort
   - Quick delivery
   - Transport support

2. **Monitoring**
   - Pain response
   - Mobility
   - Side effects
   - New symptoms

## Side Effect Management

### 1. Acute Effects
| Effect | Management | Duration |
|--------|------------|----------|
| **Pain Flare** | Dexamethasone | 1-5 days |
| **Nausea** | Antiemetics | During RT |
| **Fatigue** | Rest/hydration | 1-2 weeks |

### 2. Site-Specific
| Site | Consideration | Management |
|------|---------------|------------|
| **Spine** | Cord toxicity | Dose constraints |
| **Pelvis** | Bowel symptoms | Dietary advice |
| **Ribs** | Skin reaction | Skin care |
| **Long bone** | Fracture risk | Activity guide |

## Response Assessment

### 1. Pain Response
| Timeline | Expected Response |
|----------|------------------|
| **2-4 weeks** | Initial relief |
| **4-8 weeks** | Maximum benefit |
| **Median** | 3-6 months |
| **Complete** | ~30% of patients |

### 2. Follow-up
1. **Initial**
   - Phone follow-up at 1 week
   - Clinic visit at 4 weeks
   - Pain scoring
   - Function assessment

2. **Long-term**
   - PRN visits
   - Pain monitoring
   - Fracture watch
   - Retreatment need

## Special Considerations

### 1. Retreatment
| Factor | Assessment | Action |
|--------|------------|--------|
| **Timing** | >4 weeks | Safe to proceed |
| **Response** | Prior benefit | Likely to help |
| **Dose** | Cumulative | Adjust constraints |
| **Technique** | Previous fields | Consider IMRT |

### 2. Integration
| Aspect | Consideration | Timing |
|---------|--------------|--------|
| **Systemic Rx** | Continue during RT | No break |
| **Bone agents** | Safe with RT | Continue |
| **Surgery** | Post-op timing | 2 weeks post |
| **Physical therapy** | Activity level | During RT |

## AI-Generated Summary
- Single fraction RT effective for uncomplicated metastases
- SINS score guides surgical consultation need
- Simple setup and quick delivery important
- Pain flare prophylaxis with dexamethasone
- Response assessment at 4 weeks
