From treatment planning to clinical trial eligibility, PS tools inform patient selection, risk stratification, and resource allocation. However, no single tool is optimal for all patient populations. This summary distills the strengths, limitations, and recommended uses of standard and specialty performance status tools, including digital and future-forward innovations."
