Developed in 1949, the scale ranges from 100 (fully functional) to 0 (death) in 10-point increments. Though originally created to assess chemotherapy effects, KPS remains a cornerstone in palliative medicine, neuro-oncology, and transplant eligibility, where granular insight into a patient's physical functioning is essential."

Continued efforts to digitize and objectify performance status will only expand its utility."
