      "text": "Performance status (PS) is a clinical measure of a patient's general well-being and functional capabilities in the context of disease, particularly cancer. It is crucial in oncology because it reflects a patient's ability to carry out daily activities and tolerate cancer-directed therapies. PS serves as both a prognostic indicator and a determinant of treatment eligibility. It guides decisions about therapy intensity, trial inclusion, appropriateness of surgical or radiation interventions, and transition to palliative care."

      "text": "In contrast to objective laboratory data, PS is subjectively assessed based on clinical evaluation, patient reporting, and caregiver insight. Despite this limitation, PS remains central to oncology care due to its ease of application, reproducibility in structured formats, and clinical relevance."
