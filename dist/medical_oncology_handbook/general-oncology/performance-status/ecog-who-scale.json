It ranges from 0 (fully active) to 5 (deceased) and plays a central role in oncologic decision-making. The ECOG scale is not only used to evaluate treatment fitness but also to predict prognosis, assess clinical trial eligibility, and guide palliative care needs. Despite its simplicity, its subjectivity and lack of granularity require clinicians to contextualize its use within broader clinical assessments."
