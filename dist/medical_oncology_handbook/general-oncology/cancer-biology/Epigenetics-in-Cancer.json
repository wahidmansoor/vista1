      "text": "Epigenetics encompasses heritable yet reversible modifications to gene expression that do not alter the underlying DNA sequence. These modifications orchestrate chromatin structure and accessibility, thereby regulating transcriptional activity. In cancer, aberrant epigenetic programming is not merely a consequence of oncogenesis—it actively drives tumor initiation, progression, and resistance to therapy. Unlike genetic mutations, epigenetic alterations are reversible, making them attractive diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets."
