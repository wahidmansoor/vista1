      "text": "Invasion and metastasis define the lethal nature of malignant tumors. Unlike benign growths confined to a single site, malignant cells possess the capacity to invade surrounding tissues and disseminate to distant organs. This complex, multistep phenomenon—collectively referred to as the metastatic cascade—is responsible for over 90% of cancer-related mortality. Understanding the mechanisms underlying invasion and metastasis is crucial for prognosis, surveillance, and therapeutic intervention in cancer care."
