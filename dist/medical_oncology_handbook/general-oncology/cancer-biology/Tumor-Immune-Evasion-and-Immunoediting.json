      "text": "Tumor cells are capable of avoiding immune detection and destruction through a process known as immune evasion. This ability plays a central role in carcinogenesis and the progression of malignancy. The concept of tumor immunoediting captures the dynamic interplay between tumors and the immune system across three evolutionary stages: elimination, equilibrium, and escape. Understanding these mechanisms is vital for advancing immunotherapies and improving clinical outcomes."
