The theory of clonal evolution, first proposed by Peter Nowell in 1976, describes how tumors originate from a single mutated progenitor cell but accumulate diverse subclones over time. These subclones compete, coexist, and respond differently to environmental and therapeutic pressures, giving rise to tumor heterogeneity."
