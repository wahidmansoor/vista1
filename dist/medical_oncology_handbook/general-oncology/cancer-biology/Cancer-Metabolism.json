      "text": "Cancer metabolism refers to the reprogramming of cellular bioenergetic and biosynthetic pathways that allow malignant cells to sustain rapid proliferation, adapt to hostile microenvironments, evade immune responses, and resist therapies. Unlike normal cells that predominantly rely on mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), cancer cells often favor glycolysis even in the presence of oxygen—a phenomenon known as the Warburg effect."

Understanding the metabolic adaptations of cancer cells unveils a powerful therapeutic axis with the potential to disrupt tumor viability, sensitize to treatment, and improve clinical outcomes."

From the Warburg effect to mitochondrial dependencies, metabolic adaptations are deeply intertwined with oncogenic signaling and tumor microenvironment dynamics. Exploiting these dependencies via targeted metabolic therapy, especially in combination with immunotherapy or cytotoxic agents, holds promise for improving clinical outcomes across tumor types. Precision metabolic profiling will be key to unlocking individualized treatment strategies in the next generation of oncology."
