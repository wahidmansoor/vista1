      "text": "Despite advances in chemotherapy, targeted agents, radiation, and immunotherapy, resistance to treatment remains a major barrier to long-term cancer control. Tumors may exhibit intrinsic resistance—present before therapy begins—or develop acquired resistance through treatment-induced selection and adaptation. Resistance involves diverse molecular pathways, immune evasion strategies, microenvironmental factors, and pharmacologic barriers, all of which contribute to therapeutic failure and disease recurrence."
