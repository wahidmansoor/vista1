      "text": "Cancer refers to a collection of diseases characterized by the autonomous and unregulated growth of cells with the potential to invade surrounding tissues and metastasize to distant organs. This transformation occurs due to a series of genetic and epigenetic changes that disrupt normal cell cycle control and cellular homeostasis."

      "text": "Cancer originates from the accumulation of mutations in genes that control cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival:\n- **Proto-oncogenes** become **oncogenes** when mutated, promoting uncontrolled cell division.\n- **Tumor suppressor genes** (e.g., *TP53*, *RB1*, *BRCA1*) lose function through mutations or deletions, removing growth inhibition.\n- Mutations can be inherited (germline) or acquired (somatic) due to environmental exposures like carcinogens, radiation, or viruses.\n\nGenomic instability, often resulting from defects in DNA repair pathways (e.g., mismatch repair in Lynch syndrome), accelerates mutation accumulation."

Over time, further mutations lead to **clonal evolution**, creating a genetically diverse tumor mass. This **intratumoral heterogeneity** complicates treatment and contributes to therapeutic resistance and relapse."
