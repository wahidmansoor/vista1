Cancer biology not only explains the origins of malignancy but also informs diagnostic pathways, therapeutic planning, and post-treatment surveillance. Key pillars—such as tumor mutation profiles, immune escape, metabolic rewiring, and therapy resistance—are central to personalized medicine. This summary integrates foundational science with evidence-based clinical strategies, grounded in the AMBOSS principles of cancer care."

From the moment of diagnosis to long-term survivorship, molecular insights influence every decision. As oncology becomes increasingly individualized, clinicians must be adept in translating genomic, immunologic, and microenvironmental data into real-world strategies. The fusion of mechanistic understanding with clinical pragmatism defines the new era of precision oncology."
