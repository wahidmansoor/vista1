# Treatment Recommendation Engine Test Fixes - Complete Report

## Overview
Successfully fixed all issues in the React test file for the cancer treatment recommendation engine. The test suite now provides comprehensive coverage with proper TypeScript types, correct mocking, and robust test scenarios.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Import Path Inconsistencies ✅
**Problem**: Mixed import paths with some using relative paths and others using incorrect prefixes.
**Solution**: 
- Standardized all import paths to use relative paths (`../../../services/...`)
- Fixed component imports to use correct relative paths
- Ensured all service imports match the actual file structure

### 2. TypeScript Type Issues ✅
**Problem**: Multiple type mismatches and missing properties.
**Solutions**:
- Replaced `score_breakdown` with `match_breakdown` to match the `MatchingResult` interface
- Added missing `safety_assessment` property with complete `SafetyAssessment` type
- Fixed all mock data properties to match TypeScript interfaces exactly
- Removed invalid `description` property from `TreatmentProtocol` mock
- Updated `PatientProfile` mock data to match interface requirements

### 3. Mock Implementation Fixes ✅
**Problem**: Incorrect mock structure and non-functional mocks.
**Solutions**:
- Fixed service mocking to work with both named exports and default exports
- Updated mock structure for `advancedTreatmentMatcher` and `enhancedTreatmentDatabase`
- Fixed toast mock to match the actual `useToast` hook signature
- Added proper Framer Motion mocks to prevent animation issues in tests
- Implemented proper mock reset between tests with `beforeEach` and `afterEach`

### 4. Test Logic Improvements ✅
**Problem**: Incorrect DOM queries and async patterns.
**Solutions**:
- Updated screen queries to match actual rendered text patterns
- Fixed filter tests to use correct DOM selectors and values
- Improved async/await patterns to prevent race conditions
- Added proper error boundaries for async operations
- Enhanced protocol selection logic with robust DOM querying

### 5. Missing Test Coverage Added ✅
**New Tests Added**:
- Empty recommendations scenario
- Loading state edge cases (with proper timeout handling)
- User interaction flows (expand/collapse, protocol selection)
- Error handling for different failure modes
- Accessibility compliance tests (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
- Real-world data scenarios (elderly patients, comorbidities)
- Performance testing with large datasets

### 6. Integration Tests Enhanced ✅
**Improvements**:
- Proper service integration testing with correct mock expectations
- Realistic test scenarios that test actual integration points
- Database service integration verification
- Comprehensive parameter validation for service calls

### 7. Code Quality and Cleanup ✅
**Enhancements**:
- Removed all unused imports
- Consistent code formatting throughout
- Proper TypeScript type annotations
- Comprehensive JSDoc comments
- Organized test structure with clear describe blocks
