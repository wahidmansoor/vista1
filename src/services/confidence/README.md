# Confidence Scoring System

A comprehensive confidence scoring and validation system for AI-powered medical responses. This system evaluates responses based on multiple factors and provides clear confidence metrics and professional consultation recommendations.

## Core Components

### 1. ConfidenceService
The main service that calculates confidence scores based on:
- Evidence strength from medical literature
- Context relevance
- Model certainty
- Data quality
- Calibration metrics

### 2. Confidence Configuration
Flexible configuration system with presets for different use cases:
- Default configuration
- Emergency mode (stricter thresholds)
- Strict mode (higher evidence requirements)

```typescript
const config = ConfidenceConfigFactory.createDefaultConfig();
// or
const emergencyConfig = ConfidenceConfigFactory.createEmergencyConfig();
```

### 3. AI Service Integration
Decorator pattern for easy integration with existing AI services:

```typescript
const baseService = new OpenAIService(config);
const serviceWithConfidence = new AIServiceWithConfidence(baseService);

// Use like normal AI service, but now with confidence scoring
const response = await serviceWithConfidence.processRequest({
  prompt: "What is the recommended treatment for...",
  metadata: { queryCategory: "treatment" }
});

console.log(response.confidence.level); // 'high', 'moderate', etc.
console.log(response.confidence.score); // Detailed metrics
```

## Confidence Levels

- **Very High** (≥0.9): Strong evidence and high certainty
- **High** (≥0.7): Good evidence with reasonable certainty
- **Moderate** (≥0.5): Acceptable for general guidance
- **Low** (≥0.3): Use with caution
- **Very Low** (<0.3): Not recommended for use

## Query Categories

Different thresholds for different types of medical queries:
- `diagnosis`: Disease identification and assessment
- `treatment`: Treatment plans and interventions
- `medication`: Drug recommendations and dosing
- `emergency`: Urgent/critical care situations
- `general`: General medical information

## Evidence Sources

The system evaluates evidence from multiple sources:
- Research papers
- Clinical guidelines
- Medical databases
- Expert consensus

## Warning System

Automatic warning generation for low-confidence responses:
```
⚠️ CONFIDENCE WARNING ⚠️
Confidence Level: LOW
Professional consultation is strongly recommended.

Limitations:
- Limited evidence base
- High model uncertainty

Recommendations:
- Consult with a medical professional
- Seek additional evidence sources
```

## Calibration System

Continuous improvement through feedback:
```typescript
// Record actual outcomes for calibration
confidenceService.recordCalibrationData('diagnosis', predictedScore, actualScore);

// Get calibration metrics
const metrics = confidenceService.getCalibrationMetrics('diagnosis');
console.log(metrics.accuracy, metrics.bias, metrics.samples);
```

## Best Practices

1. Always specify query category when possible:
```typescript
const response = await service.processRequest({
  prompt: "...",
  metadata: { queryCategory: "treatment" }
});
```

2. Provide context for better confidence scoring:
```typescript
const response = await service.processRequest({
  prompt: "...",
  context: {
    patientHistory: "...",
    labResults: "...",
    currentMedications: "..."
  }
});
```

3. Handle low confidence appropriately:
```typescript
if (response.confidence.requiresConsultation) {
  // Take appropriate action (e.g., escalate to human medical professional)
}
```

4. Monitor calibration metrics:
```typescript
const metrics = confidenceService.getCalibrationMetrics('diagnosis');
if (metrics.accuracy < 0.8) {
  // Consider retraining or adjusting thresholds
}
```

## Safety Notes

1. The confidence system is a supplementary tool, not a replacement for professional medical judgment
2. Always err on the side of caution with medical advice
3. Regular calibration and threshold adjustments are recommended
4. Document all confidence-based decisions for audit purposes
