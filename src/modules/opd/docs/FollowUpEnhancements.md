# Follow-Up Oncology Module Enhancements

## 🎯 Feature Overview

The Follow-Up Oncology module has been enhanced with several clinically meaningful tools for improved long-term patient tracking and monitoring. These enhancements maintain the existing tab layout while adding powerful new features.

### 1. 📆 Diagnostic Timeline Tracker
- Visualizes key milestones in diagnosis journey
- Interactive timeline with status indicators
- Key events tracked:
  - First Visit
  - Imaging
  - Biopsy
  - Histopathology
  - Molecular Testing
  - Final Diagnosis

### 2. 📈 Performance Score Trend Card
- Interactive chart showing ECOG and KPS scores over time
- Dual-axis visualization for both metrics
- Color-coded trends for easy interpretation
- Interpretive guides for both scoring systems
- Responsive design adapting to viewport size

### 3. 🧠 Smart Follow-Up Summary
- AI-powered summary generation
- Exports to Markdown format
- Includes:
  - TNM staging
  - Performance status
  - Key clinical findings
  - Recommended follow-up schedule
  - Areas requiring attention

## 💻 Code Snippet Highlights

### DiagnosticTimeline Component
```typescript
interface TimelineEvent {
  type: 'first_visit' | 'imaging' | 'biopsy' | 'histopathology' | 'molecular' | 'final';
  date: string;
  detail: string;
  status: 'completed' | 'pending' | 'scheduled';
}
```

### PerformanceScoreChart Integration
```typescript
interface PerformanceData {
  date: string;
  ecog: number;  // 0-4 scale
  kps: number;   // 0-100 scale
}
```

## 📊 Mock Data Examples

### Diagnostic Events
```typescript
{
  type: 'biopsy',
  date: '2025-03-22',
  detail: 'Core needle biopsy performed',
  status: 'completed'
}
```

### Performance Scores
```typescript
{
  date: '2025-03-15',
  ecog: 0,
  kps: 100
}
```

## 🔄 Integration Flow
1. CancerSelector triggers loading of cancer-specific data
2. DiagnosticTimeline displays the diagnosis journey
3. PerformanceScoreChart shows trends over time
4. SmartFollowUpSummary generates comprehensive reports

## 🎨 UI/UX Considerations
- Consistent use of motion animations for smooth transitions
- Clear visual hierarchy with card-based layout
- Responsive grid system adapting to different screen sizes
- Dark mode compatible color scheme
- Interactive elements with hover states and tooltips

## 🔜 Suggested Follow-ups

### Short Term
1. Add export functionality for timeline data
2. Implement custom date range selection for performance trends
3. Add more granular molecular testing details

### Medium Term
1. Integrate with external imaging systems
2. Add comparative analysis between different cancer types
3. Implement multi-patient timeline views

### Long Term
1. Machine learning for predicting performance score trends
2. Integration with hospital EMR systems
3. Advanced analytics dashboard

## 📝 Notes
- All components use TypeScript for type safety
- Performance optimizations implemented using React.memo where appropriate
- Error boundaries implemented for robust error handling
- Mock data provided for development and testing
