# 1. Introduction

## What is Palliative Care?
Palliative care is a **specialised, multidisciplinary approach** aimed at preventing and relieving suffering and supporting the best possible quality of life for patients and families facing life‑limiting illness. Unlike hospice—which is restricted to the final months of life in many jurisdictions—palliative care can (and should) be integrated **from diagnosis** alongside curative or disease‑modifying treatments.

> 🌱 **Clinical Pearl:** Early palliative involvement (≤ 8 weeks from diagnosis of advanced cancer) improves symptom burden, mood, patient satisfaction, and even survival in some studies (Temel et al., *NEJM* 2010).

### Core Domains
| Domain | Examples of Interventions |
|--------|---------------------------|
| **Physical** | Pain, dyspnoea, nausea, delirium, fatigue |
| **Psychological** | Anxiety, depression, adjustment disorders |
| **Social** | Family meetings, caregiver support, community resources |
| **Spiritual/Existential** | Chaplaincy services, meaning‑centred therapy |
| **Ethical/Legal** | Advance care planning, capacity assessment, MAiD counselling |

## Principles of Palliative Medicine
1. **Patient‑centred & family‑inclusive** decision‑making.  
2. **Communication excellence**: honest, empathic dialogue about goals, values, and prognosis.  
3. **Interdisciplinary teamwork** drawing on medicine, nursing, social work, psychology, pharmacy, rehabilitation, and chaplaincy.  
4. **Evidence‑based symptom management** with ongoing reassessment.  
5. **Continuity across settings** (inpatient, outpatient, home, hospice).  
6. **Support for healthcare providers** through debriefing and education.

## Scope of Practice
| Setting | Typical Activities |
|---------|-------------------|
| **Outpatient** | Advance care planning, pain optimisation, psychosocial counselling |
| **Inpatient consult** | Complex symptom crises, goals‑of‑care clarification, transition planning |
| **Specialised units / Hospice** | Intensive comfort care, palliative sedation, terminal care protocols |
| **Community / Home care** | Home visits, tele‑palliative follow‑ups, caregiver training |

Palliative clinicians also lead **education** and **quality‑improvement** initiatives to embed best practices institution‑wide.

## Interdisciplinary Team Roles
| Discipline | Key Contributions |
|------------|------------------|
| **Physician / APP** | Medical assessment, prescribing, prognostication, leading family meetings |
| **Registered Nurse** | Symptom monitoring, medication administration, caregiver teaching |
| **Pharmacist** | Drug interactions, opioid rotation plans, deprescribing |
| **Social Worker** | Financial counselling, psychosocial assessment, discharge planning |
| **Psychologist / Psychiatrist** | Therapy for mood disorders, cognitive screening |
| **Physiotherapist / OT** | Mobility aids, energy conservation strategies |
| **Dietitian** | Nutritional optimisation, cachexia counselling |
| **Chaplain / Spiritual Care** | Existential support, rites and rituals |

Effective palliative programmes hold **weekly interdisciplinary rounds** to synchronise these contributions.

## When to Initiate Palliative Care
| Trigger | Examples |
|---------|----------|
| **Disease‑based** | Metastatic or stage IV malignancy, progressive neurodegeneration |
| **Symptom‑based** | Uncontrolled pain, dyspnoea, delirium despite standard therapy |
| **Treatment‑based** | Considering first‑line chemotherapy with limited benefit, HSCT, CAR‑T |
| **Request‑based** | Patient/family desires focus on comfort or decision support |

> ⚠️ **Caution:** Late referrals (< 30 days before death) limit the ability to build rapport and optimise quality of life; strive for **early, parallel care**.

## Suggested Referral Criteria (Quick‑Reference)
▣ ECOG ≥ 3 or PPS ≤ 60 %  
▣ ≥ 2 unplanned hospitalisations in 6 months  
▣ Prognostic uncertainty ("Would I be surprised if this patient died within 12 months?")  
▣ Complex caregiver distress

## AI‑Generated Summary (for rapid review)
- Palliative care is a **holistic discipline** integrating symptom control, psychosocial, and spiritual support from diagnosis through end of life.  
- Early referral improves outcomes and should run **in parallel** with disease‑directed therapy.  
- Core principles emphasise patient‑centred goals, evidence‑based management, and interdisciplinary collaboration.  
- Team includes physicians, nurses, pharmacists, social workers, therapists, dietitians, and chaplains.  
- **Referral triggers**: advanced disease, refractory symptoms, high healthcare utilisation, or explicit patient/family request.
