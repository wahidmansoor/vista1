# Assessment Tools in Palliative Care

## Symptom Assessment Scales

### Edmonton Symptom Assessment System (ESAS)
**Purpose**: Rapid screening of common symptoms in palliative care
**Domains**: 9 core symptoms + 1 patient-defined symptom
**Scale**: 0 (no symptom) to 10 (worst possible)

**Core Symptoms:**
1. **Pain** - Physical discomfort
2. **Fatigue** - Tiredness, lack of energy
3. **Nausea** - Feeling of sickness
4. **Depression** - Feeling sad or down
5. **Anxiety** - Feeling nervous or worried
6. **Drowsiness** - Feeling sleepy
7. **Appetite** - Not feeling like eating
8. **Wellbeing** - How you feel overall
9. **Dyspnea** - Shortness of breath
10. **Other** - Patient-identified concern

**Interpretation:**
- **Score 0-3**: Mild symptoms
- **Score 4-6**: Moderate symptoms (intervention recommended)
- **Score 7-10**: Severe symptoms (urgent intervention required)

**Frequency**: Daily in acute settings, weekly in outpatient care

### Palliative Performance Scale (PPS)
**Purpose**: Functional status assessment in palliative care
**Domains**: Ambulation, activity level, self-care, intake, consciousness

| PPS % | Ambulation | Activity & Evidence of Disease | Self-Care | Intake | Conscious Level |
|-------|------------|------------------------------|-----------|---------|-----------------|
| 100% | Full | Normal activity, no disease | Full | Normal | Full |
| 90% | Full | Normal activity, some disease | Full | Normal | Full |
| 80% | Full | Normal activity with effort | Full | Normal or reduced | Full |
| 70% | Reduced | Unable normal job/work | Full | Normal or reduced | Full |
| 60% | Reduced | Unable hobby/house work | Occasional assistance | Normal or reduced | Full or confusion |
| 50% | Mainly sit/lie | Unable to work, extensive disease | Considerable assistance | Normal or reduced | Full or confusion |
| 40% | Mainly in bed | Unable most activity | Mainly assistance | Normal or reduced | Full/drowsy ± confusion |
| 30% | Totally bedbound | Unable any activity | Total care | Reduced | Full/drowsy ± confusion |
| 20% | Totally bedbound | Unable any activity | Total care | Minimal to sips | Full/drowsy ± confusion |
| 10% | Totally bedbound | Unable any activity | Total care | Mouth care only | Drowsy or coma ± confusion |
| 0% | Death | - | - | - | - |

**Clinical Applications:**
- **PPS 70-100%**: Generally appropriate for active rehabilitation
- **PPS 50-60%**: Transition zone, consider goals of care
- **PPS 10-40%**: Focus on comfort care
- **PPS <20%**: Median survival days to weeks

| 3 | Capable of only limited self-care; confined to bed or chair >50% of waking hours |
| 4 | Completely disabled; cannot carry on any self-care; totally confined to bed or chair |
| 5 | Dead |

**Clinical Use**: Treatment decisions, prognosis, clinical trial eligibility

### Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS)
**Purpose**: Physician-rated functional capacity assessment

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 100% | Normal; no complaints; no evidence of disease |
| 90% | Able to carry on normal activity; minor signs or symptoms of disease |
| 80% | Normal activity with effort; some signs or symptoms of disease |
| 70% | Cares for self; unable to carry on normal activity or do active work |
| 60% | Requires occasional assistance but able to care for most needs |
| 50% | Requires considerable assistance and frequent medical care |
| 40% | Disabled; requires special care and assistance |
| 30% | Severely disabled; hospitalization indicated, death not imminent |
| 20% | Very sick; hospitalization necessary; active supportive treatment necessary |
| 10% | Moribund; fatal processes progressing rapidly |
| 0% | Dead |

**Correlation**: KPS ≈ PPS; ECOG 0-1 ≈ KPS 80-100%; ECOG 2 ≈ KPS 60-70%

## Pain Assessment Tools

### Numeric Rating Scale (NRS)
**Scale**: 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain imaginable)
**Use**: Most common, suitable for cognitively intact adults
**Advantage**: Simple, quick, standardized

### Visual Analog Scale (VAS)
**Format**: 10cm line from "no pain" to "worst pain"
**Use**: Research settings, precise measurement
**Limitation**: Requires motor skills, less practical clinically

### Faces Pain Scale - Revised (FPS-R)
**Format**: 6 faces showing increasing pain intensity
**Use**: Children, adults with cognitive impairment, language barriers
**Scoring**: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 (correlates with NRS)

### Behavioral Pain Scale (BPS)
**Use**: Non-verbal patients, severe cognitive impairment
**Domains**: Facial expression, vocalization, body movement
**Scoring**: 3-12 points total

| Domain | 1 Point | 2 Points | 3 Points | 4 Points |
|--------|---------|----------|----------|----------|
| Facial | Relaxed | Partially tightened | Fully tightened | Grimacing |
| Vocalization | None | Sighs/moans | Calling out | Crying |
| Body Movement | Normal | Guarded movements | Restless/agitated | Rigid |

**Interpretation**: >5 indicates significant pain requiring intervention
