# Cancer Genetics and Hereditary Syndromes

## Fundamentals of Cancer Genetics

### Basic Concepts
- Germline vs. somatic mutations
- Inheritance patterns
- Penetrance and expressivity
- Gene-environment interactions

### Risk Assessment
- Family history taking
- Pedigree analysis
- Risk calculation models
- Genetic testing criteria

## Common Hereditary Cancer Syndromes

### Breast and Ovarian Cancer
#### HBOC Syndrome
- BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations
- Other high-risk genes
- Risk assessment
- Management guidelines
- Surveillance protocols

### Colorectal Cancer Syndromes
#### Lynch Syndrome
- MMR gene mutations
- Amsterdam/Bethesda criteria
- Surveillance recommendations
- Risk-reducing strategies

#### FAP and Variants
- APC gene mutations
- Clinical presentation
- Surveillance protocols
- Surgical considerations

### Other Common Syndromes
#### Li-Fraumeni Syndrome
- TP53 mutations
- Cancer spectrum
- Surveillance protocols
- Management challenges

#### Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia
- MEN1, MEN2 variants
- Clinical manifestations
- Screening recommendations
- Treatment approaches

## Genetic Testing

### Testing Methodologies
- Single gene testing
- Multi-gene panels
- Whole exome sequencing
- RNA/protein analysis

### Pre-test Considerations
- Patient selection
- Informed consent
- Cost and insurance
- Privacy concerns

### Result Interpretation
- Variant classification
- Clinical significance
- Results disclosure
- Family implications

## Cancer Risk Management

### Surveillance Protocols
- Cancer-specific screening
- Frequency recommendations
- Age to begin/end
- Imaging modalities

### Risk-Reducing Strategies
- Prophylactic surgery
- Chemoprevention
- Lifestyle modifications
- Follow-up care

### Family Planning
- Preimplantation testing
- Reproductive options
- Family communication
- Psychosocial support

## Clinical Implementation

### Genetic Counseling
- Pre-test counseling
- Risk communication
- Results disclosure
- Post-test support

### Multidisciplinary Care
- Team coordination
- Specialist referrals
- Care transitions
- Documentation

### Patient Education
- Risk communication
- Lifestyle counseling
- Support resources
- Follow-up planning

## Special Considerations

### Pediatric Issues
- Testing timing
- Consent/assent
- Psychological impact
- Family dynamics

### Ethical Considerations
- Privacy concerns
- Discrimination
- Family disclosure
- Insurance implications

### Research Participation
- Clinical trials
- Registry studies
- Biobank participation
- Novel therapies

## Quality Assurance

### Documentation
- Pedigree maintenance
- Test results
- Clinical decisions
- Follow-up plans

### Program Development
- Staff education
- Protocol updates
- Quality metrics
- Outcome tracking

## Key Practice Points
1. Comprehensive family history is essential
2. Risk assessment should guide testing
3. Results impact multiple family members
4. Regular surveillance is critical
5. Multidisciplinary care optimizes outcomes
