More than a descriptor, PS helps determine a patient's fitness for treatment, the appropriateness of therapeutic intensity, and the timing of palliative care. Especially in patients with comorbidities or advanced age, PS acts as a vital component of individualized cancer care. Widely used scales like ECOG and Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) integrate clinical observation and functional assessment into a standardized framework to guide decision-making at every phase of care."
