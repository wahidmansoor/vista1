      "text": "Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are a rare, specialized subpopulation within tumors that possess stem-like properties, including self-renewal, differentiation, and long-term tumor propagation. Functionally analogous to normal stem cells, CSCs sustain tumor growth, resist therapy, and contribute to relapse and metastasis. Their adaptability and interaction with the tumor microenvironment make them a critical, albeit elusive, therapeutic target in oncology."
