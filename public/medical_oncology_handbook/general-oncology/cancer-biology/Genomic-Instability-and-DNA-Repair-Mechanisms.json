      "text": "Genomic instability is a central hallmark of cancer and is increasingly recognized as a driver of neurodegeneration, immune dysfunction, and premature aging. It refers to an increased tendency of alterations in the genome—ranging from single nucleotide changes to large-scale chromosomal rearrangements. This instability results from continuous DNA damage and defective repair mechanisms. DNA integrity is safeguarded by complex, evolutionarily conserved repair systems, which, when compromised, accelerate the accumulation of mutations, fuel malignant transformation, and promote resistance to therapy."

The integrity of the genome is continually challenged, but cells possess elegant repair systems to prevent catastrophe. When these fail, the consequences are profound—resulting in malignancy, immune dysfunction, or degenerative diseases. With the expansion of precision oncology, targeting DNA repair defects has evolved from a biological insight to a therapeutic mainstay. Emerging technologies—from genome editing to AI-guided interpretation—will further enhance our ability to detect, model, and correct genomic instability."
