      "text": "Oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes are pivotal regulators of cellular homeostasis. Their alterations underpin the molecular framework of oncogenesis, from initiation to metastasis. Oncogenes typically originate from proto-oncogenes—normal genes involved in cell signaling and growth—that become pathologically activated via mutations, amplifications, or translocations. Tumor suppressor genes, conversely, act as genomic guardians, ensuring appropriate cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, and apoptosis. Cancer results from the imbalance between these opposing forces, leading to unchecked proliferation and survival."
