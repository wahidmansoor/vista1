      "text": "The tumor microenvironment (TME) encompasses the cellular and acellular milieu in which tumor cells exist and evolve. It includes immune cells, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, extracellular matrix (ECM), cytokines, metabolites, and the vasculature. This dynamic ecosystem is shaped by reciprocal interactions between cancer cells and the host tissue and plays a critical role in every stage of tumor development—from early neoplastic transformation to metastasis, immune escape, and resistance to therapy."

It modulates tumor growth, immune escape, metastasis, and treatment response. As we move toward increasingly personalized cancer care, the ability to map and modulate the TME—at cellular, molecular, and spatial levels—will be indispensable. Future strategies will not only target tumor cells but reshape the microenvironment to make it less hospitable to malignancy and more permissive to immune clearance."
