# Early Stage Breast Cancer

## Indications for RT
Radiation therapy is indicated for early-stage breast cancer in the following scenarios:
- After breast-conserving surgery (BCS)
- Selected cases post-mastectomy with high-risk features
- Management of the regional nodal volumes in node-positive disease

> üéØ **Clinical Pearl:** For patients > 70 years with hormone receptor-positive tumors < 2cm, low-grade, node-negative disease, and clear margins after BCS, omission of RT may be considered based on PRIME II trial data.

## Treatment Planning Process

### 1. Patient Positioning
| Element | Specification |
|---------|--------------|
| **Position** | Supine, arms above head |
| **Immobilization** | Breast board, indexed arm supports |
| **Alignment** | Three-point laser setup |
| **DIBH** | Consider for left-sided tumors |

### 2. Target Volumes
| Volume | Definition |
|--------|------------|
| **CTV_breast** | Entire breast tissue from visible/palpable limits |
| **PTV_breast** | CTV + 5mm (avoid skin/air) |
| **CTV_boost** | Tumor bed + 10-15mm |
| **PTV_boost** | CTV_boost + 5mm |

### 3. Critical OARs
‚ñ£ **Ipsilateral Lung**  
‚ñ£ **Heart** (especially for left-sided)  
‚ñ£ **Contralateral Breast**  
‚ñ£ **Spinal Cord**  
‚ñ£ **Esophagus**  

## Dose Specifications
| Volume | Conventional | Hypofractionated |
|--------|--------------|------------------|
| **Whole Breast** | 50Gy/25fx | 40Gy/15fx |
| **Boost** | 10-16Gy/5-8fx | 10Gy/4fx |

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Caution:** For DIBH treatments, verify breath hold consistency with daily CBCT and surface guidance when available.

## Dose Constraints
| Structure | Constraint |
|-----------|------------|
| **Heart Mean** | < 4Gy (L-sided) |
| **Heart V25** | < 10% |
| **Ipsi Lung V20** | < 30% |
| **Contra Breast Mean** | < 3Gy |

## Treatment Technique
1. **Field Arrangement**
   - Opposed tangential fields
   - Consider IMRT for complex anatomy
   - DIBH for left-sided cases
   
2. **Plan Optimization Goals**
   - 95% of prescribed dose to 95% of PTV
   - Hot spots < 107%
   - Minimize contralateral breast dose
   - Meet OAR constraints

3. **IGRT Protocol**
   - Daily kV imaging
   - Weekly CBCT
   - Surface guidance if available

## Common Toxicities
| Acute | Late |
|-------|------|
| Skin erythema | Breast fibrosis |
| Fatigue | Skin changes |
| Breast edema | Rib fracture (rare) |

## Management Pearls
1. **Skin Care**
   - Maintain skin cleanliness
   - Use recommended moisturizers
   - Avoid sun exposure
   
2. **Follow-up**
   - Weekly on-treatment visits
   - Assessment of skin reactions
   - Document breast size changes

## AI-Generated Summary
- Early breast RT requires careful attention to patient positioning and target delineation
- Hypofractionation is standard for most cases based on strong evidence
- DIBH should be considered for left-sided cases to minimize cardiac exposure
- Daily image guidance and surface tracking optimize treatment accuracy
- Regular skin care and monitoring are essential for toxicity management
