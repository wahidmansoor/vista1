# Cancer Staging Systems

## Overview

Staging systems classify the extent and spread of cancer. Accurate staging is essential for:

- Treatment planning
- Prognostication
- Clinical trial eligibility
- Standardized communication

## 1. TNM Classification (AJCC/UICC)

The **Tumor (T), Node (N), Metastasis (M)** system is the most widely used across solid tumors.

- **T**: Size and extent of the primary tumor
- **N**: Involvement of regional lymph nodes
- **M**: Presence of distant metastases

Example – **Pancreatic Cancer** (AJCC 8th edition):

| Stage | TNM Description                            |
|-------|--------------------------------------------|
| IA    | T1 (≤2 cm), N0, M0                         |
| IB    | T2 (>2–4 cm), N0, M0                       |
| IIA   | T3 (>4 cm), N0, M0                         |
| IIB   | Any T, N1 (1–3 nodes), M0                  |
| III   | Any T, N2 (≥4 nodes) or T4, any N, M0      |
| IV    | Any T, any N, M1                           |

## 2. Tumor-Specific Systems

### A. **Colorectal Cancer**

- Also uses AJCC TNM staging
- Historically used **Dukes classification** (A–D), now replaced

### B. **Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC)**

The **Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC)** staging system integrates tumor burden, liver function (Child-Pugh), and performance status (ECOG).

| BCLC Stage | Criteria |
|------------|----------|
| 0 (Very early) | Single tumor ≤ 2 cm, Child–Pugh A, ECOG 0 |
| A (Early) | ≤ 3 tumors ≤ 3 cm or single > 2 cm, Child–Pugh A/B, ECOG 0 |
| B (Intermediate) | Multinodular tumors, Child–Pugh A/B, ECOG 0 |
| C (Advanced) | Vascular invasion or metastases, ECOG 1–2 |
| D (End-stage) | Child–Pugh C or ECOG > 2 |

**Note**: TNM is not routinely used for HCC due to exclusion of liver function and PS.

## 3. Alternate Systems

### A. **Child-Pugh Score** (Hepatic Function)

Used alongside HCC staging; classifies liver disease into:
- A (well-compensated)
- B (significant compromise)
- C (decompensated)

### B. **Other Cancer-Specific Systems**

- **Ann Arbor**: Lymphomas
- **FIGO**: Gynecologic cancers
- **Revised International Prognostic Index (R-IPI)**: Non-Hodgkin lymphoma

---

## Clinical Considerations

- Always combine **anatomic** (TNM) and **physiologic** (PS, liver function) parameters.
- Imaging and histopathology are integral to accurate staging.
- Regular updates (e.g., AJCC editions) refine prognostic relevance.
