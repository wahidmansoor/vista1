# Performance Status in Oncology

## Overview

Performance status (PS) reflects a patient's level of function and ability to perform daily activities. It is a critical component in oncology used to:

- Determine eligibility for cancer therapies
- Predict prognosis
- Guide clinical trial enrollment
- Assess response to treatment

## Commonly Used Scales

### 1. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status

| **Grade** | **Description** |
|----------:|-----------------|
| 0         | Fully active; able to carry on all pre-disease performance without restriction |
| 1         | Restricted in physically strenuous activity but ambulatory and able to carry out light work |
| 2         | Ambulatory and capable of all self-care but unable to carry out work activities; up and about >50% of waking hours |
| 3         | Capable of only limited self-care; confined to bed or chair >50% of waking hours |
| 4         | Completely disabled; cannot carry on any self-care; totally confined to bed or chair |
| 5         | Dead |

### 2. Karnofsky Performance Status Scale

- Ranges from 100 (normal, no complaints) to 0 (dead) in increments of 10
- Often used in palliative care to guide therapy and hospice eligibility

### 3. Palliative Performance Scale (PPS)

- Modified version of the Karnofsky scale
- Incorporates five domains:
  - Ambulation
  - Activity level and evidence of disease
  - Self-care
  - Intake
  - Level of consciousness

## Clinical Application

Performance status is a key element in:

- **Treatment planning**:
  - ECOG 0–1: typically eligible for intensive therapies
  - ECOG ≥2: consider dose modifications or palliative care
  
- **Staging systems**:
  - BCLC for hepatocellular carcinoma includes ECOG in staging
  - Clinical trials often use ECOG or Karnofsky as inclusion criteria

- **Prognosis estimation**:
  - Lower performance status correlates with poorer overall survival
  - Used in prognostic models across malignancies

## Considerations in Clinical Practice

- Use standardized, validated tools to assess performance status objectively
- Reassess frequently, especially before initiating or changing therapy
- Consider age, comorbidities, and frailty in performance assessments
- Involve multidisciplinary teams for patients with functional decline
