# Cancer Biology

## Overview

Cancer biology examines the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which normal cells transform into malignant ones. Carcinogenesis is a multistep process involving genetic and epigenetic changes that result in unchecked proliferation, resistance to apoptosis, invasion, and metastasis.

## Carcinogenesis

### Definition

A multistep transformation of normal cells into neoplastic cells, driven by accumulated genetic mutations—either inherited or acquired—leading to monoclonal expansion and tumor formation.

### Phases

1. **Initiation**: DNA damage occurs.
2. **Promotion**: Damaged DNA is passed on during replication.
3. **Latency**: Prolonged phase with further mutations but no visible tumor.
4. **Progression**: Malignant transformation and clonal proliferation.

## Hallmarks of Cancer

1. **Sustained proliferative signaling**
   - Oncogenes (e.g., *RAS*, *MYC*, *BRAF*)
   - Growth factor receptors (e.g., EGFR, ERBB2)

2. **Evasion of growth suppressors**
   - Tumor suppressor gene inactivation (e.g., *TP53*, *RB1*)
   - Loss of contact inhibition (e.g., E-cadherin dysfunction)

3. **Resistance to cell death**
   - Mutations in apoptotic regulators (e.g., *BCL-2*, *BAX*, *TP53*)

4. **Replicative immortality**
   - Reactivation of telomerase to maintain telomere length

5. **Deregulated cellular energetics**
   - Warburg effect: aerobic glycolysis predominates

6. **Induction of angiogenesis**
   - Mediated by VEGF, FGF; via vasculogenesis or neoangiogenesis

7. **Activation of invasion and metastasis**
   - Breakdown of basement membranes and ECM remodeling

8. **Immune evasion**
   - ↓ MHC-I expression
   - Secretion of immunosuppressive cytokines (e.g., TGF-β)
   - Upregulation of immune checkpoints (PD-L1, CTLA-4)

9. **Tumor-promoted inflammation**
   - Enhances tumor growth and genomic instability

## Tumor Microenvironment

- Composed of stromal cells, immune cells, blood vessels, and ECM
- Influences immune escape, angiogenesis, and therapeutic resistance

---

## Immune Evasion Mechanisms

- ↓ MHC-I on tumor cells → impaired cytotoxic T-cell recognition
- Upregulation of CTLA-4 and PD-L1/PD-L2 to inhibit T-cell activation
- Secretion of immunosuppressive factors (e.g., IL-10, TGF-β)
- Expression of multidrug resistance proteins (e.g., MDR1/P-glycoprotein)

## Field Cancerization

### Concept

An entire tissue field becomes primed for carcinogenesis due to chronic exposure to carcinogens or inflammation.

### Examples

- Colorectal cancer in ulcerative colitis
- HPV-related oropharyngeal cancer
- UV-induced skin cancers
- Bladder cancer from industrial carcinogens

## Clinical Relevance

- Understanding the molecular hallmarks of cancer facilitates the development of:
  - Targeted therapies (e.g., EGFR inhibitors)
  - Immune checkpoint inhibitors (e.g., anti-PD-1, anti-CTLA-4)
  - Biomarkers for early detection and prognostication
