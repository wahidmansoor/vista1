# Production Error Debugging - Status Report

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED SETUP

### 1. Enhanced Error Tracking Infrastructure
- **Source Maps**: Enabled in production builds (`sourcemap: true`)
- **Enhanced ErrorBoundary**: Added unique error IDs, comprehensive context capture
- **Global Error Tracking**: Captures unhandled errors and promise rejections
- **Debug Routes**: Added `/debug/errors` and `/debug/analyzer` endpoints

### 2. Build Status
- **‚úÖ Production Build**: Successfully completed with source maps
- **‚úÖ Development Server**: Running on http://localhost:3004
- **‚úÖ Source Maps Generated**: All chunks now include source map files

## üîß DEBUGGING TOOLS AVAILABLE

### Debug Pages (Available in Development)
1. **Real-time Error Monitor**: http://localhost:3004/debug/errors
   - Live capture of all errors as they occur
   - Detailed error context and stack traces
   - Error filtering and search capabilities

2. **Production Error Analyzer**: http://localhost:3004/debug/analyzer
   - Pre-loaded with your specific production error
   - Analyzes the `PZ`, `FZ` function calls
   - Provides potential causes and solutions

### Enhanced Error Logging
- **Unique Error IDs**: Every error gets a UUID for tracking
- **Comprehensive Context**: URL, user agent, timestamp, component stack
- **LogRocket Integration**: Enhanced with better error context
- **localStorage Persistence**: Errors stored locally for analysis

## üöÄ NEXT STEPS FOR PRODUCTION DEBUGGING

### Step 1: Deploy Enhanced Build
```powershell
# Use the provided deployment script
.\deploy-debug.ps1
```

### Step 2: Access Debug Tools in Production
1. Navigate to `https://your-domain.com/debug/errors` for real-time monitoring
2. Visit `https://your-domain.com/debug/analyzer` to analyze the specific error

### Step 3: Reproduce the Error
When the error occurs again, you'll now have:
- **Readable Stack Traces**: Source maps will show actual function names instead of `PZ`, `FZ`
- **Enhanced Context**: URL, component hierarchy, user agent
- **Error ID**: Unique identifier for tracking specific occurrences

### Step 4: Monitor Enhanced Error Information
Check these locations for improved error data:
- Browser console (enhanced error logging)
- `/debug/errors` page (real-time capture)
- LogRocket dashboard (enhanced context)
- localStorage (persistent error storage)

## üîç ORIGINAL ERROR ANALYSIS

The error you reported:
```
PZ @ bundle.js:2:123456
FZ @ bundle.js:2:789012
```

**Likely Causes** (based on React patterns):
1. **Routing Issue**: Navigation between medical records/patient data
2. **State Management**: Redux/context updates during async operations
3. **Component Unmounting**: Cleanup during route transitions
4. **API Integration**: Failed requests or data parsing errors

## üìù MONITORING CHECKLIST

When the error reproduces, collect:
- [ ] Error ID from console
- [ ] Full readable stack trace
- [ ] URL where error occurred
- [ ] User actions leading to error
- [ ] Browser/device information
- [ ] Any network errors in DevTools

## üõ†Ô∏è TROUBLESHOOTING

### If Debug Routes Don't Work
1. Ensure you're in development mode or debug routes are enabled in production
2. Check that AppRoutes.tsx includes the debug routes
3. Verify no authentication blocking access

### If Source Maps Don't Load
1. Confirm `sourcemap: true` in vite.config.ts
2. Check that .map files are deployed alongside .js files
3. Verify server serves .map files with correct MIME type

### If Error Tracking Doesn't Work
1. Check browser console for errorTracker initialization
2. Verify localStorage permissions
3. Confirm ErrorBoundary is wrapping components

## üìû IMMEDIATE ACTION ITEMS

1. **Deploy the enhanced build** with source maps to production
2. **Test debug endpoints** in development: http://localhost:3004/debug/errors
3. **Monitor for the error** to reproduce with enhanced tracking
4. **Review enhanced logs** when error occurs

The debugging infrastructure is now comprehensive and ready to capture detailed information about your production error!
