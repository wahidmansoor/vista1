# Treatment Guidance Tool Transformation Roadmap

## Project Overview

### Objective
Transform the existing `DiseaseProgressTracker.tsx` component into a comprehensive `TreatmentGuidanceTool.tsx` - converting it from a simple disease tracking system into a clinical decision support tool that provides evidence-based treatment recommendations based on patient clinical parameters.

### Key Requirements
- Remove localStorage persistence in favor of real-time database queries
- Replace mock AI recommendations with evidence-based algorithms
- Integrate with existing Supabase `cd_protocols` table
- Use useReducer instead of multiple useState hooks for better state management
- Restructure UI from disease tracking tabs to clinical guidance workflows
- Expand cancer database with comprehensive treatment protocols

---

## Current Status (âœ… COMPLETED)

### 1. Core Component Transformation
- âœ… **Fixed compilation errors**: Replaced non-existent `Target` icon with `Activity` from lucide-react
- âœ… **Fixed type mismatches**: Resolved biomarker type compatibility issues
- âœ… **Updated component structure**: Transformed from disease tracking to treatment guidance interface

### 2. Database Integration
- âœ… **Integrated Supabase service**: Connected TreatmentGuidanceTool with existing `generateClinicalRecommendations` service
- âœ… **Enhanced recommendation logic**: Added comprehensive debugging and fallback recommendations
- âœ… **Improved error handling**: Added specific database error messages and validation

### 3. UI/UX Enhancements
- âœ… **Enhanced recommendation display**: Added comprehensive UI showing:
  - Protocol codes and treatment summaries
  - Drug components with dosing information
  - Biomarker requirements and eligibility criteria
  - Supportive care recommendations
  - Monitoring requirements
- âœ… **Improved user feedback**: Added loading states and error handling

### 4. Database Schema Expansion
- âœ… **Created comprehensive SQL migration**: Written `20250601_expand_cancer_protocols.sql` with 8 detailed cancer protocols:
  - **NSCLC**: EGFR-mutated, ALK-positive, High PD-L1 expression
  - **Breast Cancer**: HER2-positive
  - **Colorectal Cancer**: KRAS wild-type
  - **Prostate Cancer**: Metastatic castration-resistant (mCRPC)
  - **Melanoma**: BRAF-mutated
  - **Ovarian Cancer**: Platinum-sensitive recurrent
- âœ… **Database optimization**: Added indexes and created views for improved protocol searching
- âœ… **Clinical data structure**: Proper JSON structure for drugs, eligibility, monitoring, and toxicity data

### 5. Code Quality Improvements
- âœ… **Updated imports**: Fixed all component references in CDU modules
- âœ… **Enhanced error handling**: Added comprehensive debugging and fallback mechanisms
- âœ… **Real clinical references**: Included actual clinical trial references and evidence levels
